                <b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 - 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in 
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
